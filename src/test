🧩 Spike Summary: CRDP → ERDP Migration — Environment Analysis and Roadmap
Objective

Analyze and define the migration approach, environment readiness, and rollout timeline for transitioning from CRDP to ERDP across DEV, SIT, and UAT environments, ensuring minimal impact on ongoing Q4 release activities.

1️⃣ Context & Background

The CRDP→ERDP migration involves domain rebranding and infrastructure updates across all environments.

Multiple discussions were held with Infra, DevOps, App Teams, QA, and Security/SSO to finalize environment sequencing and migration windows.

Supporting artifacts include:

📊 Excel Roadmap outlining migration steps, owners, dependencies, and sign-off targets.

✉️ Email confirmations clarifying the decision to follow SIT → UAT migration sequence and validation flow.

2️⃣ Environment Readiness & Dependencies
Step	Task	Owner	Status / Notes
1	Communication with App Leads, DevOps, Infra	Sujeet	✅ Done
2	Stakeholder Communication (PO/BA)	Laxmi Koeruru	🔄 Ongoing
3	Request new domain (DEV first)	Infra – Kyle	✅ Completed 10/10
4	Request new TOKEN ID setup	Security / SSO Team	⏳ In progress
5	Update container with new domain + cert	DevOps – Kavya, Arun	⏳ Pending verification
6	Deploy application (DEV→UAT, API)	App Team	🚧 Planned – Nov 1st week
7	Integration testing with consumers	QA + App Owners	🚧 Planned – Nov 2nd week
8	Rollout to SIT / UAT / PROD	All Teams	🔜 Pending post-Q4 sign-offs
3️⃣ Q4 Release Sign-Offs & Migration Timeline
Environment	Q4 Release Sign-Off	Migration Sign-Off (CRDP→ERDP)
SIT	🗓️ Nov 10 2025	🗓️ Dec 29 2025
UAT	🗓️ Nov 17 2025	🗓️ Jan 5 2026
PROD	TBD	TBD

Migration will occur after Q4 sign-offs of SIT and UAT environments.

This ensures a stable and validated baseline before the domain migration rollout.

4️⃣ Coordination Highlights

Michael Morales (Infra) confirmed DEV and SIT aliases are created and ready for validation.

Kavya and Arun (DevOps) leading verification and container configuration checks.

Kyle (Infra) handling DNS + cert requests; Security/SSO managing TOKEN ID setup.

QA and App Owners to validate applications post-migration in UAT.

5️⃣ Risks & Considerations

Possible delays in certificate issuance or DNS propagation.

Overlap with Wave7 UAT testing—coordination required to avoid conflicts.

Pending app-level allowlist and config updates for new domain endpoints.

6️⃣ Next Steps

✅ Complete DevOps verification for DEV and SIT aliases.

🔜 Request and configure UAT alias post-SIT validation.

🔁 Align migration window with Q4 calendar (no overlap with testing blackout).

🧾 Prepare final migration checklist and rollback plan by mid-December 2025.

7️⃣ Outcome / Closure Note

The spike successfully produced a validated migration roadmap, with environment sequencing, sign-off dates, and ownership alignment across teams.
All analysis activities are complete, and this Epic/Spike can now be closed.
Implementation work will proceed under corresponding execution tickets following Q4 sign-offs.

Would you like me to also generate a “Resolution Comment” (2–3 lines) that you can paste into the JIRA comment field when closing the Epic? It would be phrased like a formal closure note for audit trace.

Hi David,

Thanks for your quick response!

Sure — let me clarify. The new role ERDP_CTPA_ADMIN was created and tested under the LLE namespace in GES (Authorization/Entitlement Services) for the CTPA feature of the CRDP/ERDP Platform (AIT 72882).

Now, we’d like the same role to be provisioned in the Production namespace so it’s available for use in the production environment as well.

In short, the action needed is to replicate this role definition (including resource /globalaccess/admin and action readwrite) under the Production namespace.

If you’re not the right contact for pushing roles to Production, could you please let me know who I should reach out to or if a ServiceNow/Entitlement request needs to be opened?

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards,
Sujeet Jaiswal

Hi Om,

Thanks for the note.

We currently do not have a redirect feature in place today.

After Venkat raised the question about keeping both URLs active at the same time, we did consider a possible redirect approach from the old URL to the new one. However, implementing that would require additional changes, proper planning, and a clear roadmap — including development, deployment, and testing. This is not part of today’s migration scope.

My earlier question to the team was essentially:

If we need a redirect or want both URLs to remain usable, then we should hold today’s migration, revisit the design, and include the redirect solution in a future release.

If we are aligned with only the new ERDP DEV URL being active, then we can proceed with today’s migration as originally planned and decommission the old URL.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Thanks and regards,
Sujeet

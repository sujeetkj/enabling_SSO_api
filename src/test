Hi Neharika,

Yes — that was exactly the issue.

The job with run_id = 74, which was manually moved to INPROGRESS, was preventing the API from submitting any new jobs. Our API is designed to submit a new job only when there are no jobs in INPROGRESS status on the model side.
Because run_id 74 remained stuck in INPROGRESS, all subsequent submissions stayed in SUBMITTED state and did not progress.

Once you corrected the status for run_id 74, the API was able to resume processing. As you can now see on the screen, all the previously blocked jobs have moved forward and are showing as COMPLETED.

We will continue to look into the UI issue you mentioned regarding GCP ID not displaying after selecting a financed emission reporting period.

Thanks again for the update and for validating this in DEV.

Best regards,
Sujeet

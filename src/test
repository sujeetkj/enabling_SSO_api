Subject: Read-only access to CRDP_DIST schema — LLE (DEV/SIT/UAT) & PROD

Hi <Name/Team>,

Please grant read-only access to the CRDP_DIST schema. CRDP_WEB and CRDP_DIST are in the same database.

Service IDs

LLE (DEV/SIT/UAT, etc.): <SERVICE_ID_LLE>

PROD: <SERVICE_ID_PROD>

Request

Grant read-only access (e.g., SELECT on required tables/views/materialized views; SELECT on sequences if applicable) to CRDP_DIST for the above service IDs.

We can use schema-qualified names or synonyms—happy to follow your standard.

If you need a specific object list for least-privilege, we can provide it. Kindly proceed and let us know if any additional details are required from our side.

Best regards,
Sujeet

Remediation Write-up for Acceptance Criteria #2 and #3

Remediation for Requirement #2 – Ensure compliance with data-privacy regulations during user-data collection

Based on confirmation from the Product Owner and validation from the Glassbox team (email references attached), CRDP UI does not collect or display any PII/PHI/NPI/sensitive information that would require masking or additional protection before instrumentation.
Glassbox will only capture standard interaction-level events such as navigation paths, clicks, page views, and time spent—none of which contain sensitive attributes or user-identifiable data.

Glassbox team has explicitly confirmed that:

All captured data is tied only to the user’s BankID that is already authorized via application roles.

No masking is required because CRDP UI does not expose or transmit sensitive fields to Glassbox.

Access to Glassbox data is role-based and restricted to approved personas only.

Therefore, requirement #2 is fully satisfied through existing product design and Glassbox’s role-controlled access model.

Remediation for Requirement #3 – Provide real-time analytics dashboards with actionable insights

The real-time analytics capability for CRDP UI will be provided directly through the Glassbox Portal Dashboard, not through CRDP UI itself.
Once instrumentation is active for CRDP UI (AIT-72882), all analytics related to session behavior, user journeys, clicks, and heatmaps will automatically appear under the application profile in Glassbox.

To access these dashboards, users must:

Submit an ARM request to obtain appropriate analytics roles for Glassbox.

Select CRDP UI (AIT-72882) as the application they need access to.

Once approved, users will be able to view all real-time dashboards and insights through the Glassbox platform.

No additional development or UI integration on CRDP side is required for this functionality.

Therefore, requirement #3 is fulfilled through the Glassbox platform’s native analytics capabilities, with access provisioned via ARM request workflow.

🔒 Final Consolidated Statement (Short Version for Jira)

Req #2: CRDP UI does not expose any sensitive data requiring protection prior to Glassbox ingestion. Glassbox team and PO have both confirmed no PII/PHI/NPI is involved. All data capture is limited to interaction-level metadata, and access is restricted via role-based Glassbox permissions.

Req #3: Real-time analytics dashboards are provided on the Glassbox portal. Users must raise an ARM request to obtain access to the analytics for AIT-72882. No CRDP UI changes are required.

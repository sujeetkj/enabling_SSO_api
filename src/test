Updated Analysis & Design Summary

As part of this spike, we began analyzing the requirements for automating Data Sample and Data Dictionary functionalities in the CRDP UI. During the analysis, we identified that a prerequisite capability is needed before implementing the Data Automation API use case.

To support user-specific visibility and configuration of data, we need a User Preference framework along with Admin Control capabilities. This will allow:

Users to define how they want to view or land on a screen.

Administrators to control what data and metadata (sample data, dictionary fields, etc.) should be exposed to end-users.

This requirement is not limited to the current Data Automation use case; it is foundational for future modules such as Tier Sheet, Data Lineage, dashboards, and any component where personalized user settings are required.

Therefore, the first phase of this spike focuses on:

Designing a generic, reusable model for storing and retrieving User Preferences.

Defining Admin Control rules and configuration logic to govern what information is allowed to be displayed to users.

This design will serve as a base framework across all upcoming CRDP UI use cases.

✅ 2. Short Description Version (to update the "Description" field)

This spike covers the analysis and design for Data Automation features in the CRDP UI. During discovery, we identified a prerequisite requirement: a centralized User Preference and Admin Control framework. This will allow admins to manage visibility of sample data and dictionary fields and allow users to configure how they want to view data. The design is being created to support not only the Data Automation API but also future use cases like Tier Sheet, Data Lineage, dashboards, and any screen needing personalized user settings.

✅ 3. Extended Detailed Version (if you want to update the full spike description)

Spike Objective
Analyze and design the foundational components required to support Data Automation (data sample and data dictionary) in the CRDP UI.

Key Finding
During analysis, we determined that implementing Data Automation requires a supporting capability: a unified User Preference system accompanied by Admin Control functionality. These components are essential to ensure both controlled visibility and personalized user experience.

Why this is needed

Users need the ability to save preferences (e.g., preferred landing view, filters, or visibility settings).

Admins need control over which datasets, metadata fields, or automation outputs are allowed to be surfaced in the UI.

This design ensures compliance, controlled exposure, and a consistent user experience.

Future Scalability
The framework we design in this spike will not only support the Data Automation API but also seamlessly extend to other future use cases, including:

Tier Sheet

Data Lineage

Dashboards and widgets

Any other feature requiring saved preferences or visibility rules.

Phase-1 Deliverables (under this spike)

Conceptual data model for User Preferences.

Admin Control design for governing visibility and configuration.

Reusable architecture that future modules can consume.

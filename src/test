Hi All,

Following today’s discussion, please find the updated plan for the CRDP→ERDP migration:

The CRDP→ERDP migration for environments will be executed after the Q4 release sign-offs of SIT and UAT.

Q4 Release Sign-Offs:

SIT Sign-Off: November 10, 2025

UAT Sign-Off: November 17, 2025

Migration Sign-Offs (CRDP→ERDP):

SIT Environment: December 29, 2025

UAT Environment: January 5, 2026

This sequence ensures that migration will occur only after the Q4 release environments have been validated and signed off, minimizing any overlap with ongoing release activities.

Thanks & Regards,
Sujeet Jaiswal

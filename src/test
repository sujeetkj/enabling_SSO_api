Hi Tracey, Hi Shobhana,

I wanted to check on the expected timeline for the Glassbox review and any planned changes to the script. From the platform application side, should we consider the integration complete at this stage and proceed with moving the changes to production, or should we hold off until the vendorâ€™s review is finalized?

Please let me know your thoughts so we can align the next steps accordingly.

Best regards,
Sujeet

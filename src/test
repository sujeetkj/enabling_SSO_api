Hi Team,

As discussed, we will proceed with the UAT and PROD migration planning after the successful completion of the DEV environment migration.

Once the DEV migration is completed, we will roll out the UAT2 migration, since the SIT environment will be utilized for releases scheduled in the December 2025 pipeline.
Before initiating the UAT rollout, we will communicate the plan with POs and relevant stakeholders for review and alignment.

We are currently targeting the completion of the DEV environment migration by November 15, 2025.
A follow-up meeting is scheduled for Tuesday to finalize the UAT and PROD migration timelines once DEV progress is reviewed.

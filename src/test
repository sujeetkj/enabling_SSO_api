Hi Michael,

Thanks for the update and for confirming the alias setup for DEV and SIT environments. Appreciate the quick turnaround and coordination with Kyle on this.

Looping in Kavya (DevOps) and Arun (DevOps) — they will take this forward for verification and validation from the DevOps side.

We’ll review the configurations and share confirmation once validation is complete, along with any feedback on the UAT setup timeline.

Thanks again for the support and collaboration.

Best regards,
Sujeet Jaiswal

Dear Zulfia,

Thank you for your message. I would like to clarify the circumstances regarding the July 10th, 2025 transaction in my Fidelity account (ending in XXXX6257).

This trade was not a discretionary sell order placed directly by me. The transaction occurred when Fidelity transitioned my assets from a self-managed account into a Professionally Managed Account. As part of the transfer process, certain securities were deemed ineligible, and liquidation was triggered under Fidelityâ€™s procedures.

While I understand from Fidelity that this liquidation was based on a box I had checked during the transfer setup, I did not knowingly or intentionally authorize the sale of this specific security. It was executed automatically by Fidelity as part of the managed account enrollment process. Fidelity would be able to confirm these details of the transfer.

Also, as requested, I confirm that I was not in possession of any material non-public information regarding Zomedica Corp (ZOMDF) at the time of the trade.

Thank you for your guidance, and please let me know if any additional confirmation from Fidelity is required.

Best regards,
Sujeet Jaiswal
